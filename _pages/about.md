## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science working at the intersection of wireless networking, edge intelligence, federated learning, and continual learning. My recent work explores how intelligent communication systems can efficiently adapt, learn, and operate under resource constraints in dynamic environments, with applications in UAV systems, vehicular networks, and smart healthcare infrastructures.

My research has been published in leading IEEE journals and conferences, including IEEE TMC, IEEE/ACM ToN, IEEE Network Magazine. I also contribute to the scholarly community as a reviewer for journals such as IEEE JSAC, IEEE TMC, IEEE IOTJ, IEEE TVT, IEEE TYCB, IEEE TNSM, ICT Express, and Digital Communications and Networks, etc. My broader goal is to advance adaptive and learning-driven communication systems that support scalable, autonomous, and trustworthy intelligence across distributed networks.
